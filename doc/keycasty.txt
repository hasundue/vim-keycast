*keycasty.txt*            For Vim/Neovim            Last change: 2022 April 30

INTRODUCTION                                           *keycasty-introduction*

vim-keycasty is an experimental keycast plugin for Vim/Neovim.

Still work in progress. Use it just for testing or for fun.

DESIGN                                                       *keycasty-design*


- vim-keycasty estimates key inputs from each event (cursor movement, text modification, etc.), rather than watching real key inputs, which is not possible on Neovim
- Keycast is shown beside the cursor, so that one can follow both of the cursor movement and the keycast easily


LIMITATIONS                                             *keycasty-limitations*


- Keycasts from the plugin are not necessarily identical with true key inputs
- Events other than cursor movement are not supported yet
- Custom key mappings are not supported yet

CONFIGURATION                                         *keycasty-configuration*

The plugin refers the updatetime value for the time for which the pop-up
automatically disappears if no input is received.

Set it as an appropriate value like 1000 ms, but notice that this may affect
